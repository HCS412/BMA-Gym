# Verifiers Directory

This folder houses verifier models and logs used to evaluate clone outputs during debate.

Each verifier assesses:
- **Novelty** – Is the output materially new?
- **Coherence** – Is the reasoning sound and internally consistent?
- **Guardrail Compliance** – Does the output obey safety/ethics boundaries?

Verifier scores decide which clones get merged into the trunk.
